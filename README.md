# Wutch

`wutch` watches for changes in the directories and runs a shell command for
every change. It can also open a browser a display whatever is in the build
directory, just like Live Server.

Common use case for Wutch involves writing docs with [Sphinx][sphinx]. Wutch will
watch for the changes in all `*.rst` files and automatically rebuild documentation.
It will also open a browser window pointing to the build directory and inject
every built webpage with a code that will auto-refresh that page after each
rebuild.

## Installation

```shell
pip install wutch
```

## Usage

Just run wutch in the directory where you want to watch for the changes.
By default, `wutch` will:

* Watch for every change in the current directory.
* Ignore changes in the `_build/` and `build` directories.
* Run `sphinx-build` shell command for every change in the files.
* Open a browser pointing to `index.html` in the `_build` directory.
* Automatically refresh that page every time you change the files
  and shell command runs.

```shell
$ wutch -vvv

## Configuration

### Parameters

```shell
-h, --help            show this help message and exit
-c COMMAND, --command COMMAND
                      Shell command executed in response to file changes. Defaults to: sphinx-build.
-p [PATTERNS ...], --patterns [PATTERNS ...]
                      Matches paths with these patterns (separated by ' '). Defaults to: ['*'].
-P [IGNORE_PATTERNS ...], --ignore-patterns [IGNORE_PATTERNS ...]
                      Ignores file changes in these patterns (separated by ' '). Defaults to: [].
-d [DIRS ...], --dirs [DIRS ...]
                      Directories to watch (separated by ' '). Defaults to: ['.'].
-D [IGNORE_DIRS ...], --ignore-dirs [IGNORE_DIRS ...]
                      Ignore file changes in these directories (separated by ' '). Defaults to: ['_build', 'build'].
-w WAIT, --wait WAIT  Wait N seconds after the command is finished before refreshing the web page. Defaults to: 1.
-b BUILD, --build BUILD
                      Build directory containing files to render in the browser. Defaults to: _build/html.
-I [INJECT_PATTERNS ...], --inject-patterns [INJECT_PATTERNS ...]
                      Patterns of files to inject with JS code that refreshes them on rebuild (separated by ' '). Defaults to: ['*.htm*'].
-i INDEX, --index INDEX
                      File that will be opened in the browser with the start of the watcher. Defaults to: index.html.
--host HOST           Host to bind internal HTTP server to. Defaults to: localhost.
--port PORT           TCP port to bind internal HTTP server to. Defaults to: 5010.
-B, --no-browser      Do not open browser at wutch launch. Defaults to: False.
-S, --no-server       Do not start the webserver, just launch the shell command. Defaults to: False.
-v, --verbose         Log verbosity. Has four levels: error, wargning, info, and debug. Can be stacked: -v (for warning) or -vvv (for debug).
-V, --version         Display version of the wutch.
```

### Loading order

Wutch loads configuration settings in the following priority:

1. Command line arguments
2. Environment variables starting with `WUTCH_`
3. Configuration file `wutch.cfg`
4. Default variables

Every variable can be specified in any of the sources above, thanks to
[`ilexconf`][ilexconf] configuration management library.

For example, `dirs` variable that lists directories to watch can be
specified in several ways:

**Command line:**

```shell
wutch --dirs . ../other_dir
```

**Environment variables starting with `WUTCH_`:**

```shell
export WUTCH_DIRS=". ../other_dir"
```

**Configuration file `wutch.cfg`:**

```json
{
    "dirs": [".", "../other_dir"]
}
```

## Wutch's documentation is built using `wutch`

Take a look at the `wutch.cfg` file at the root of the repository. This
serves as a somewhat common configuration for Sphinx dependent documentation.

Wutch documentation is developed using `wutch` and this config below.

```json
{
    "dirs": ["docs"],
    "ignore_dirs": [],
    "patterns": ["*.rst", "*.py"],
    "ignore_patterns": [],
    "command": "make -C docs rebuild",
    "build": "docs/_build/html",
    "inject_patterns": ["*.html"],
    "index": "index.html",
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 5010
}
```
